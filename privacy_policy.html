          respect the privacy of our online visitors. We may collect information
          on or through this website that can personally identify you. For
          example, we collect personally identifiable information which you

          any third party other than our service providers who assist us in
          providing the information and/or services we are providing to you. To
          the extent that we do share your personal information with a service
          provider, we would only do so if that party has agreed to comply with
          our privacy standards as described in this privacy policy. Some of our
          service providers may be overseas and may not be subject to Australian
          Privacy Laws. Please contact us if you require specific details. Any

          without promises of confidentiality, may be kept, used and disclosed
          by us on a non-confidential basis. We are free to use and reproduce
          any such information freely, and for any purpose whatsoever.
          Specifically, we will be free to use any ideas, concepts, know-how or
